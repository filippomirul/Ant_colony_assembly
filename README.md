# Ant_colony_assembly

This repository contains an algorithm which uses the strategy of ant colony optimization to solve a de novo assembly problem.

"The final version of the code is contained in the Final_ANT_algorithm.py file, that writes the results to the assembly_results file."

"The Data folder contains a series of genomes with whom to test the algorithm (given a powerful infrastructure), plus the TP53 gene file that was used to perform short tests."

"The results folder contains the results of runs performed on TP53, considering different lengths of the input sequence, together with the convergence plots."
